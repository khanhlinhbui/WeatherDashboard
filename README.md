# Weather Dashboard
## About
This website creates a weather dashboards based on various cities that the user wishes to input. The user can search for a city and add it to a list. For a given city, the website will be able to show the current weather conditions as well as future weather conditions (weather forecast), and the city will be added to the search history with the help of local storage. For a given city, the weather dashboard will show the city name, the dates, the weather conditions (using icons, like sunny, rainy, partly cloudy, etc), the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. For the UV index in particular, it is color coded to indicate if the UV index is favorable, moderate, or severe. The user can select from the search history to bring back up the corresponding weather conditions for that city.
